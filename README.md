==============

The code is taken from the Udacity course in Introduction to Machine Learning Course. The task of the students was to complete the various tasks and understand the basics of the different tecniques used in machine learning. 

I followed this course during the summer 2020.

Syllabus

Lesson 1: Welcome to Machine Learning

   Learn what Machine Learning is and meet Sebastian Thrun!
   Find out where Machine Learning is applied in Technology and Science.
 
Lesson 2: Naive Bayes

   Use Naive Bayes with scikit learn in python.
   Splitting data between training sets and testing sets with scikit learn.
   Calculate the posterior probability and the prior probability of simple distributions.
    
Lesson 3: Support Vector Machines

   Learn the simple intuition behind Support Vector Machines.
   Implement an SVM classifier in SKLearn/scikit-learn.
   Identify how to choose the right kernel for your SVM and learn about RBF and Linear Kernels.
    
Lesson 4: Decision Trees

  Code your own decision tree in python.
  Learn the formulas for entropy and information gain and how to calculate them.
  Implement a mini project where you identify the authors in a body of emails using a decision tree in Python.
    
Lesson 5: Choose your own Algorithm

   Decide how to pick the right Machine Learning Algorithm among K-Means, Adaboost, and Decision Trees.
    
Lesson 6: Datasets and Questions

   Apply your Machine Learning knowledge by looking for patterns in the Enron Email Dataset.
   You'll be investigating one of the biggest frauds in American history!
    
Lesson 7: Regressions

   Understand how continuous supervised learning is different from discrete learning.
    Code a Linear Regression in Python with scikit-learn.
    Understand different error metrics such as SSE, and R Squared in the context of Linear Regressions.
  
Lesson 8: Outliers

   Remove outliers to improve the quality of your linear regression predictions.
   Apply your learning in a mini project where you remove the residuals on a real dataset and reimplement your regressor.
   Apply your same understanding of outliers and residuals on the Enron Email Corpus.
    
 Lesson 9: Clustering
 
   Identify the difference between Unsupervised Learning and Supervised Learning.
   Implement K-Means in Python and Scikit Learn to find the center of clusters.
   Apply your knowledge on the Enron Finance Data to find clusters in a real dataset.
